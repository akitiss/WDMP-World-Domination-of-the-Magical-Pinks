              <h4>Travel Budgeting + Currency</h4>
              <p>Being in a foreign place can be eye-opening and invigorating, but when it comes to finding 
                quality and luxury in travel, it all comes down to a matter of money. Wherever you are, and 
                wherever you’re going, travel money is what gets you from point A to point B, gets you the food 
                on your plate, the room view you want, and the experiences you can’t justify missing. Handling 
                foreign currency can get complicated: money is not worth the same amount in every country, and 
                because your home currency is often not accepted, currency exchange is unavoidable.</p>
              <p>Exchange rates differ widely across country borders and fluctuate constantly according 
                to how well the economy is doing. The best way to check up on the most recent currency 
                exchange rates is by visiting Oanda.com. Oftentimes, travelers use this knowledge to their 
                advantage by vacationing where their dollar is currently worth most and 
                avoiding those destinations where their dollar is worth the least.The best way to exchange 
                currency is to find out if your bank has an affiliate abroad (such as Barclays and Bank of 
                America), which offers the best exchange rates. Hotel and airport counters, in contrast, 
                typically offer poorer rates and high commission fees for the service, while out-of-network 
                ATMs can charge you up to three percent for withdrawing cash. To avoid this, use a credit card 
                that waives all transaction fees, such as Chase Sapphire Preferred. </p>
              <p>Another tip when traveling: try and use up all the foreign bills and coins on you before 
                leaving said country. Often, exchanging these bills back into your home currency can cost you
                an extra fee you can avoid completely if you’re mindful.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="list-item-2">
              <h4>Packing</h4>
              <p>We love dust bags for storing shoes and separating delicate items of clothing. Travel-sized 
                jewelry holders help make sure necklaces don't get tangled and rings don't get lost. And new, 
                high-tech suitcases have charging ports, GPS trackers, and other innovations to make packing 
                less of a chore. With additional fees for checked bags, most travelers aim to fit 
                everything they need into a single carry-on bag.</p>
                <p>The best way to accomplish this is simply to 
                pack light. By choosing clothes that all share the same color palette, you can mix and match 
                garments to create new outfits with ease. Of course, there are a few tried-and-true methods of 
                cramming everything you want into that one bag. Roll, don't fold. And skip the bulky platform heels 
                and extra jacket. (Or, if you must, wear them on the plane.) Stick to fabrics that won't wrinkle. 
                And limit yourself to just two pairs of shoes: one formal, one comfortable. T+L editors have 
                also been known to layer dryer sheets in between items to ensure their freshness over longer 
                journeys. For heavy bags, we like to put the weightiest objects on the bottom-end of a wheeled 
                suitcase, which makes it easier to maneuver. Dry shampoo, of course, is a life saver.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="list-item-3">
              <h4>Responsible Travel</h4>
              <p>Tourism as a whole has deep a impact on the world: on the one hand, it can, and does, 
                contribute waste, reduce natural resources, and disturb precious ecosystems. On the other, 
                the tourism industry plays a vital role in community development, conservation efforts, and 
                promoting cultural heritage. While we may never completely erase our human footprint on the 
                world’s landscapes, we can make efforts to embrace responsible travel and combat those 
                negative effects. </p>
              <p>Every choice made by the travel industry affects the environment, but traveling responsibly 
                is never out of reach, thanks to more and more companies prioritizing sustainable practices. 
                Hotels are implementing careful construction, leaving land undeveloped over a highly manicured 
                lawn. Airline carriers are turning to alternative fuels that absorb carbon and allowing 
                customers to buy carbon offsets with frequent flier miles. Even cruise lines are beginning to 
                see change, from outsourcing food from sustainable fisheries to funding coral-reef restoration 
                projects. Year in and year out, more and more companies push the envelope for responsible travel, 
                through sustainability, community development, conservation, and cultural preservation. Each 
                has a unique global vision to protect and preserve the place we travel through. Lightening one’s 
                footprint begins by reducing the energy used—in hotels or airports, reinvigorating declining 
                urban centers with edgy, art hotels, creating extraordinary experiences that introduce travelers 
                to local causes, caring for (and restoring) threatened habitats.</p>
              <p>How can I be an eco-friendly traveler? Above all, consider your own impact. Some simple 
                solutions you can incorporate on any trip: turn down your hotel room’s AC (or better yet, 
                turn it off), reuse hotel towels, pack lightly, rent a hybrid car, take a shorter cruise, 
                stay in a LEED-certified hotel, walk instead of jumping in a quick cab, and carry your own 
                water bottle.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="list-item-4">
              <h4>Travel Etiquette</h4>
              <p>Travel etiquette raises countless questions. How messy should you leave a hotel room? How 
                much should you tip a cab driver? Who owns the airplane armrest? What are appropriate 
                expectations for kids on a plane? Do you say hello to strangers on the streets of a bustling 
                metropolis? When is it okay to honk on a countryside road? Though there are some basic rules 
                of civility that are globally recognized—listening to what other people say, being aware of 
                what other people do, and interacting with other people with respect—many of the answers to 
                these questions depend on cultural context. Let Travel + Leisure guide you through the 
                sometimes confounding, sometimes delightful maze of travel etiquette.</p>
              <p>When travelers encounter a very different culture, expectations—on both sides of the culture 
                divide—change. Locals might not be surprised when Americans stick out their hand for a shake, 
                even if it might otherwise be a faux-pas. Likewise, when the French go in for a greeting kiss, 
                otherwise-averse Americans may already be prepared for the incoming lips.</p>
              <p>This tension between surprise, discomfort, and discovery is what makes travel so exciting. 
                But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t make an effort. A little research goes a long way. 
                Offer to take off your shoes before entering a private residence in Japan. Rely on your right 
                hand alone at meals in India and the Middle East. Common sense goes even longer: don’t deface 
                public property or natural spaces. (Avoid the ignoble fame of the French hitchhiker who 
                destroyed local street signs after he didn’t catch a ride in a small New Zealand town, or the 
                American social media maven who painted natural rock faces in a National Park and posted them 
                on Instagram.) And whatever you do, do not—do not— touch museum items.</p>
